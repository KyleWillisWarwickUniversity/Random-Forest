# Random-Forest
Random Forest Example for Data Analysis Pro-forma
This contains code for an example use of training and using a random forest model. The files used have been removed as I am unable to share the data.
Despite not giving any output, it is a good example of how a random forest can be used in Python for classification tasks. 
This was initially made in Jupyter notebooks and transfered over to GitHub to share it in my work.
